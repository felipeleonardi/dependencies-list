As with most Javascript projects, it is necessary to run SecureJS at the end of any project building stage. If you are using Browserify within a build system, not only does SecureJS need to run after Browserify but it needs to run at as the final stage of all project building phases.

SecureJS is tested with Browserify and no issues have been detected.
